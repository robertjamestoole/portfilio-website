# portfilio-website
personal website filled with some of my better projects to show potential employers or people of interest.


This website may be updated regularly. Currently I am only using HTML/CSS as that is what I am most comfortable using and know well enough to use when putting together a final project.

It will be a simply site so I don't have a real reason to learn a new language or library to finish it, but I may later on to fill things out.

That being said I am going to continue to learn and grow so I may change my mind and add a couple quality of life changes later down the line as it is seen fit.

Thanks for taking a look feel free to send in any commits but I am going to be sticking to HTML/CSS so keep that in mind when commiting.
